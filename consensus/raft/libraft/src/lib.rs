//! This is the Raft Distributed Consensus Protocol implemented for Rust.
//! [Raft](http://raftconsensus.github.io/) is described as:
//!
//! > Raft is a consensus algorithm that is designed to be easy to understand. It's equivalent to
//! > Paxos in fault-tolerance and performance. The difference is that it's decomposed into
//! > relatively independent subproblems, and it cleanly addresses all major pieces needed for
//! > practical systems.
//!
//! This implementation utilizes [Cap'n Proto](https://kentonv.github.io/capnproto/) for its RPC,
//! [`mio`](https://github.com/carllerche/mio) for it's async event loop.
//!
//! If this package fails to build for you it is possibly because you do not have the
//! [`capnp`](https://capnproto.org/capnp-tool.html) utility installed. You should be able to find
//! appropriate packages for most popular distributions.
//!
//! # Consuming this library
//!
//! Consuming this library works in a few parts:
//!
//! 1. Implement or consume a Persistent Log and a State Machine such that they will hook into
//!    your application desirably.
//! 2. Create a `Server` with those implementations. It will independently fire up and join the
//!    cluster.
//! 3. Interact with the cluster by issuing `.propose()` and `.query()` calls via the `Client`
//! 4. React to calls to `.propose()` and `.query()` from the implemented `StateMachine`
//!
//! ## Persistent Log
//!
//! A `Log` represents the **replicated, persistent log** of your application. It has a
//! strong ordering such that `A → B → C` and should **only** act to store information. Entries
//! placed into the log should not be acted on in any way by the consuming application as they
//! have not been committed to the cluster.
//!
//! Some ideas for a Persistent Log implementation:
//!
//!   * A PostgreSQL / SQLite instance.
//!   * A plain old file.
//!   * A vector in memory *(Note: Log compaction is still pending, so be aware of running out!)*
//!
//! > It is our belief that in many cases the implementation of `Log` will be generic to
//! > application purposes. You are encouraged to submit your own implementations to us!
//!
//! ## State Machine
//!
//! The `StateMachine` represents the **stateful representation** of your application. Events
//! are applied to the `StateMachine` in the correct ordering at the time of commit. This is where
//! your application **should** act on information.
//!
//! In the `StateMachine` there are both mutable (`.apply()`) and immutable (`.query()`) calls.
//! There is a considerable performance difference, as `.query()` calls do not pass through the
//! durable `Log` while `.apply()` events do.
//!
//! Some ideas for a State Machine implementation:
//!
//!   * A Hashmap or key-value store (Example provided)
//!   * A single register (Example provided)
//!   * Basically anything from `std::collections`
//!
//! ## Client Requests
//!
//! Client requests are the **only** way to interact with the Raft cluster. Calls to `.propose()`
//! and `.query()` are automatically routed to the relevant `Leader` node and behave as blocking
//! calls.
//!
//! This means `.propose()` won't return until the entry is durably replicated into the log of at
//! least the majority of the cluster and has been commited. `.query()` will perform better if
//! you wish to only read data and not have it pass through the persisted log.
//!
